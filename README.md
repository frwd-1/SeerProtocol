# SeerProtocol

A project for the decentralized identification of all on-chain nodes and relationships

# Tenets

- The way to formalize economic relationships is the [contract](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/formalizing-securing-relationships), and contracts are the basic building block of the market economy

- There are three properties of good contract design: observability, verifiability and privity

- Code based "smart contracts" enhance all three

- Trusted third parties are security holes

- Bitcoin derives its value from its secure enforcement of a simple contract - value transfer

- EVM based blockchains are characterized by arbitrarily complex contracts

- Without user interfaces, arbitrary smart contracts are largely invisible:

```
if (x == true) {
    printf("x is false");
}
```
