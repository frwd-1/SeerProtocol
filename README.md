The way to formalize economic relationships is the [contract](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/formalizing-securing-relationships), and contracts are the basic building block of the market economy

There are three properties of good contract design: observability, verifiability and [privity](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/formalizing-securing-relationships)

Code based "smart contracts" can enhance all three

Without user interfaces, smart contracts are largely invisible

```
if (x == true) {
    printf("x is false");
}
```
